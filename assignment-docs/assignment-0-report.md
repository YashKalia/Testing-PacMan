###### Exercise 3 :
The JPacMan project can't be tested exhaustively
because it isn't a simple program with a small number of possible inputs.
Exhaustive testing would require to use all possible permutations and 
combinations of inputs to be tested with their respective expected outputs.  
Finding all these possible test cases will make (time) costs too much, 
besides more tests doesn't necessarily mean more useful information about the program will be gained.  
Instead of exhaustive testing, we should write a sufficient number of effective tests that give us enough 
information about the quality of the project that we need. 

###### Exercise 4 :
The pesticide paradox relates the ability of insects/pests to develop a natural immunity against pesticides used to kill them if the same pesticide is used on them repeatedly,
to the fact that if the same tests are run repeatedly and errors/failures are fixed then the code being tested similarly develops immunity against the tests and only few failures
are encountered.This gives the impression that the software is working great since none of the tests are failing and the subtler bugs in the actual test methods are henceforth forgotten
which can cause problems later on.(Implication->)It is therefore important to keep regularly developing new test methods to find additional defects since testers cannot rely on the same
test cases throughout the development even if new interconnectins are aded in the software.

###### Exercise 5 :
Testing manually is expensive both in terms of manpower and time.Using automated tests is the best way to increase test coverage, and the effectiveness and efficiency of testing.
An automated testing tool is able to playback pre-recorded and predefined actions, compare the results to the expected behavior and report the success or failure of these manual
tests to a test engineer. Once automated tests are created they can easily be repeated and they can be extended to perform tasks impossible with manual testing. So automated testing is a
highly favourable and a prerequisite for building large softwares.
