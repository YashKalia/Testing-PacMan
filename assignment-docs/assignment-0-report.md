###### Exercise 3 :
The JPacMan project can't be tested exhaustively
because it isn't a simple program with a small number of possible inputs.
Exhaustive testing would require to use all possible permutations and 
combinations of inputs to be tested with their respective expected outputs.  
Finding all these possible test cases will make (time) costs too much, 
besides more tests doesn't necessarily mean more useful information about the program will be gained.  
Instead of exhaustive testing, we should write a sufficient number of effective tests that give us enough 
information about the quality of the project that we need.
